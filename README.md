ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Rodrigo, and I'm a full-stack developer passionate about technology. I primarily work with Node.js and React.js, building scalable and efficient applications.

I enjoy solving complex problems, exploring algorithms, and applying functional programming to write more expressive and robust code. I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer.
